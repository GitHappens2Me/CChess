Example Function Comment:

/*
 * computes an approximation of pi using:
 *    pi/6 = 1/2 + (1/2 x 3/4) 1/5 (1/2)^3  + (1/2 x 3/4 x 5/6) 1/7 (1/2)^5 +
 *
 *  n: number of terms in the series to sum
 *
 *  returns: the approximate value of pi obtained by suming the first n terms
 *           in the above series
 *           returns zero on error (if n is non-positive)
